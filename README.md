# UeberLeben

"Über Leben" (about life) was a participatory design workshop for 19 students of the Erich Kästner School.
In this project, the students of the 11th grade were asked to develop an artistic and technological position to explore the coexistence of human and non-human life forms.
Inspired by animals (snake, butterfly, pufferfish, pangolin, bird, and leopard), the students investigated different movement behaviors, materials, and mechanisms to create a shape-changing interface by using an arduino microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).
As part of KNALL & FORSCH - Labor für Mint und Kunst, this project was supported by the Kulturagentinnen and the Körber Stiftung.
